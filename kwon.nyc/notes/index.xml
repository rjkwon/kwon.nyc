      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re pre-med before medical school, are you post-med after?
When you&amp;rsquo;re a baby, you pass major milestones every day or every week1. Then, every month or every year. As a working adult, life (and career) seems to happen in chunks of 3–5 years, ish.
When I was pre-med, I thought my life/career would look like this:
 College, 4 years Medical school, 4 years Residency, 5 years Fellowship, 1-3 years Surgeoning, forever, until I die ← post-med starts here  Instead, what happened was/is this:</description>

      <description>Yesterday one of my colleagues in a (virtual) meeting reportedly picked up a canister of coarse sea salt, announced &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just snacking,&amp;rdquo; and proceeded to eat the salt, which confused and maybe frightened the other meeting attendees.
It reminded me of the time I was rounding with my interns and medical students in the recovery room after scrubbing out of a long case and I was hungry so I pulled an apple out of my white coat pocket, ate most of it, noticed that there weren&amp;rsquo;t any trash cans close by, and so I ate the core and seeds as well and then deposited the stem in the breast pocket of my white coat to discard later.</description>

      <description>June 2021 marks my eleventh year in New York City. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be here this long. The Plan™ was never to stay in New York for this long. The Plan™ was to come here for five years to learn how to be a surgeon, then go back to Chicago and be a surgeon and live happily ever after.
When I was younger, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think that carefully about my future, which is kind of terrifying to think about now, how I made decisions about my life without really thinking about them.</description>

      <description>As some of you have heard, I recently resigned from surgical residency, and am leaving clinical medicine.
Ten years ago, I decided to be a doctor. It was a decision that made perfect sense at the time: I wanted to help people who were suffering, and I was fortunate to have the ability and resources to gain entry into medical school. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which specialty would be my calling, but shortly after starting my clinical rotations I fell in love with surgery.</description>

      <description>Title: Transferrable skills Tags: Career changing
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a [blank], but I want to be a [&amp;lsquo;nother blank]&amp;rdquo;
 what are transferrable skills The patient with a tension pneumothorax who couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe and had impending respiratory failure but refused to sign a consent form for me to place a life-saving chest tube? That&amp;rsquo;s getting buy-in from key stakeholders. The time I went to the diner across the street from the hospital to get a box of sugar to sprinkle on a prolapsed rectum in the ER to help reduce it?</description>
