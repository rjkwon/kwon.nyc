      <description>Yesterday one of my colleagues in a (virtual) meeting reportedly picked up a canister of coarse sea salt, announced &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m just snacking,&amp;rdquo; and proceeded to eat the salt, which confused and maybe frightened the other meeting attendees.
It reminded me of the time I was rounding with my interns and medical students in the recovery room after scrubbing out of a long case and I was hungry so I pulled an apple out of my white coat pocket, ate most of it, noticed that there weren&amp;rsquo;t any trash cans close by, and so I ate the core and seeds as well and then deposited the stem in the breast pocket of my white coat to discard later.</description>

      <description>June 2021 marks my eleventh year in New York City. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be here this long. The Planâ„¢ was never to stay in New York for this long. The Planâ„¢ was to come here for five years to learn how to be a surgeon, then go back to Chicago and be a surgeon and live happily ever after.
When I was younger, I didn&amp;rsquo;t think that carefully about my future, which is kind of terrifying to think about now, how I made decisions about my life without really thinking about them.</description>

      <description>Hello, I&#39;m Rachel J. Kwon. I am a queer Korean American woman of average height in New York City. Like you, I am also a denizen of the internet. In 2016, I quit my job as a doctor (specifically, training to be a surgeon), which was one of the most important decisions of my life. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the topics I could talk about for 20 minutes without preparation, which they say is the sign of a thing you&amp;rsquo;re passionate about, or that you&amp;rsquo;re a rambler (I&amp;rsquo;m both ðŸ’…).</description>

      <description>I use Hugo and DeployHQ to generate and deploy the site, respectively, and Bitbucket to host the source code. Locally, I use Byword to write and edit Markdown files, and Sublime Text to write and edit code.
The incredibly detailed illustration of my visage was done by my friend Leigh Peterson, who also taught me how to bathe a cat. (Those were two separate favors.)
I don&amp;rsquo;t really use design software to design websites, but I probably should.</description>

      <description>As some of you have heard, I recently resigned from surgical residency, and am leaving clinical medicine.
Ten years ago, I decided to be a doctor. It was a decision that made perfect sense at the time: I wanted to help people who were suffering, and I was fortunate to have the ability and resources to gain entry into medical school. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which specialty would be my calling, but shortly after starting my clinical rotations I fell in love with surgery.</description>

      <description>Title: Transferrable skills Tags: Career changing
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a [blank], but I want to be a [&amp;lsquo;nother blank]&amp;rdquo;
 what are transferrable skills The patient with a tension pneumothorax who couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe and had impending respiratory failure but refused to sign a consent form for me to place a life-saving chest tube? That&amp;rsquo;s getting buy-in from key stakeholders. The time I went to the diner across the street from the hospital to get a box of sugar to sprinkle on a prolapsed rectum in the ER to help reduce it?</description>
