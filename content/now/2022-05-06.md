Just got back from two weeks of vacation, the longest consecutive time I've taken off fully (no email, no Slack) since 2016, when I took three months off after leaving residency. 

Trying to embrace New York spring, which as usual can't decide whether it wants to be beautiful and sunny or cold and gloomy (today is the latter).

Prepping for Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month events at work and socially, and reflecting on my own Korean American identity.

Playing around with the Mapbox API to see if I can make something cool.
