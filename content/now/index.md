Since my last update to this page in May...

* Autumn, my favorite season, is here!
* I got really into watching basketball this summer after going to a few New York Liberty games at Barclays Center. The last time I regularly followed professional basketball was in the '90s (when EVERYONE in the Chicago area followed the Michael Jordan era Bulls). I'd never seen a WNBA game before this summer and now I am obsessed.
* Work has been a bit of a roller coaster but I still wake up every morning grateful for it
