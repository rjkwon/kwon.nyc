- what are transferrable skills
- The patient with a tension pneumothorax who couldn't breathe and had impending respiratory failure but refused to sign a consent form for me to place a life-saving chest tube? That's getting buy-in from key stakeholders.
- The time I went to the diner across the street from the hospital to get a box of sugar to sprinkle on a prolapsed rectum in the ER to help reduce it? Well, that's being scrappy in a resource-limited setting.
