Someone recently asked me if working in product (or more broadly, in business) was what I expected when I left surgery. The obvious answer was no -- building useful products for people is different from surgically operating on them (less blood loss, for one. Usually). But it's funny how when two experiences are so vastly different, the similarities become that much more evident. 

(It works the other way, too, when two things are so similar on first glance that the differences come into clearer focus the more you look at them.)

In three really fundamental ways, surgery and product are actually strikingly similar. I'd hazard a guess that this is bigger than surgery and product and is actually just something generalizable to business and life.

1. Problem solving.
2. Decisionmaking.
3. Communication.

**Problem solving.** First, surgical patients have real problems that can be diagnosed and treated with a surgical approach. I say "surgical approach" because operating isn't always the best solution. But surgeons have the ultimate bias for action, and whatever you do, the impact of your actions is clearly seen. And the reality is, by the time the surgeon is called, we're expected to do something. So we usually do, and even if the patient has a bad outcome, the general feeling is, well, at least we tried something. 

**Decisionmaking.** In surgery and in product (and business), you have to be able to make quick decisions based on limited information, and act on them. And, they have to be good decisions MOST of the time. 

The exploratory laparotomy is the crown jewel of general surgery. It's a vague name for a surgery that basically implies "we're not sure what's wrong, but we know for sure something's wrong, and it's in the belly, so let's just open 'er up and have a look." 

One domain that's up for grabs is "influence without authority." At first glance, doctors have a lot of authority, and that's how they influence patient decisionmaking.
