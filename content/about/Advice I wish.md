Advice I wish I'd received, part 1

Timeline: Ready + planning

**What do people assume about you?**

I generally think of myself as self-aware, but I'm not the one to make that determination.

I've been interested in product and for a hot second thought I wanted to be a product manager, until the CEO of my company caught wind of it, sat me down for a very frank conversation, and said "I can't let you do this. It'd be a waste of your talents and I feel like it's watching a car crash in slow motion." Okay, dramatic. 

I think about how I'm perceived all the time. I care about what people think. I wish I could be some sort of rebel and say I don't care, but I do, I care deeply. One of the behaviors I'm trying to unlearn from surgery is that for so long I felt like people assumed I was lazy and stupid and I was constantly trying to prove them wrong. 

**Nobody thinks you're lazy and stupid.** 

Surgeons are the opposite of lazy and stupid. They work too much and they're obviously smart enough to operate on people. Yet early on in my non-clinical career, I realized I had been engaging in behaviors that subconsciously felt like I was trying to prove I wasn't lazy or stupid.

Example: I would work long hours for the sake of working long hours. I was worried I'd be seen as lazy.

Example: If somebody asked me a question that I didn't immediately know the answer to, whether it was medical or non-medical, I would pause to look it up just to confirm before I gave an answer. (I think I was scarred from being "pimped" and "reamed" for not knowing an answer)

Now, I'm much more confident to the point where I work to add value, meaning that I don't work certain hours just for the sake of it. I've realized there are different kinds of "work" - meetings, deep work, even idle daydreaming while on an afternoon walk has often led to aha moments of a new approach to a problem I've been noodling on. 

(I'm lucky enough to work someplace and be senior enough where people aren't always looking over my shoulder,
