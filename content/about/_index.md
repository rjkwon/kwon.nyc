<div class="headline">Hello, I'm Rachel J. Kwon. I am a queer Korean American woman of average height in New York City. Like you, I am also a denizen of the internet.</div>

In 2016, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/15/i-quit-medicine-heres-what-future-doctors-should-know">I quit my job</a> as a doctor (specifically, training to be a surgeon), which was one of the most important decisions of my life. It's one of the topics I could talk about for 20 minutes without preparation, which they say is the sign of a thing you're passionate about, or that you're a rambler (I'm both ðŸ’…). 

These days, I work in digital health, which is really cool, mostly because I get to solve the problems I saw firsthand taking care of patients except at scale. 

<!-- I have removed 122 gallbladders. "Why is that relevant?" you ask. First of all, I don't like your tone. Second of all, good question. It's not. Except sometimes when I get annoyed by someone on the street, I think to myself, "Well, at least I've probably taken out more gallbladders than they have." It is also listed as a fun fact on my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9087310/">IMDb page</a>. -->
