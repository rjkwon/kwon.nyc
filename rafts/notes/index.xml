      <description>Someone recently asked me if working in product (or more broadly, in business) was what I expected when I left surgery. The obvious answer was no &amp;ndash; building useful products for people is different from surgically operating on them (less blood loss, for one. Usually). But it&amp;rsquo;s funny how when two experiences are so vastly different, the similarities become that much more evident.
(It works the other way, too, when two things are so similar on first glance that the differences come into clearer focus the more you look at them.</description>

      <description>As some of you have heard, I recently resigned from surgical residency, and am leaving clinical medicine.
Ten years ago, I decided to be a doctor. It was a decision that made perfect sense at the time: I wanted to help people who were suffering, and I was fortunate to have the ability and resources to gain entry into medical school. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure which specialty would be my calling, but shortly after starting my clinical rotations I fell in love with surgery.</description>
